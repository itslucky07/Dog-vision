🐶 Dog Breed Classification using Transfer Learning (TensorFlow 2.0)
Welcome! In this project, we'll build a multi-class image classifier that can identify different dog breeds 🐕 using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0.

Have you ever seen a dog and wondered, "what breed is that?"
With machine learning, we can teach a model to recognize 120+ dog breeds automatically! 🚀

📚 Project Overview
This project uses data from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Challenge, containing:

    🖼️ 10,000+ labeled images

    🐕 120 unique dog breeds

We'll follow a standard deep learning workflow:

    Get the data 📥

    Prepare the data 🛠️

    Build and train a model 🤖

    Evaluate the model 📈

    Experiment and improve 🧪

    Save and reload the model 💾

🚦 Workflow Details
    1. Get Data Ready
      Download images and labels from Kaggle.

    Store and organize them for efficient loading.

2. Prepare the Data
      Preprocess images: resize ➡️ normalize ➡️ batch.

      Split into Training and Validation sets.

      Convert labels into one-hot encoded arrays.

3. Choose and Train a Model
    Use Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Hub 📦.

    Base model: MobileNetV2 (mobilenet_v2_130_224) for efficient performance.

Techniques:

    EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting 🛑

    TensorBoard for real-time training visualization 📊

4. Evaluate the Model
    Make predictions on unseen images.

    Compare predictions with the true labels.

    Visualize performance with confusion matrices and accuracy plots 📈.

5. Experiment and Improve
    Start training with a small subset (1000 images) to make sure pipeline works ⚡.

    Gradually increase dataset size for better accuracy.

    Fine-tune the model if necessary 🔥.

6. Save and Share the Model
    Export the trained model to a .h5 file or TensorFlow SavedModel format.

    Reload and reuse for inference or deployment 🎯.
